## VLSI Design Cadence Projects, Fall 2019

Repository includes material from Fall 2019, in the form of written-up projects. The projects were completed in Linux Cadence IC. 

The projects include the use of Cadence Schematics, Virtuoso Layouts, Layout Extractions, DRC Checks, LVS, Simulations and Post-Simulations.

ðŸ’½ [Project 1: Inverter Design](https://github.com/nvkoleva-ibeXiae/vlsi-design/blob/master/Inverter%20Cadence%20Design/inverter_cadence.pdf) is the design of an inverter nfet/pfet circuit as an initial schematic, after which a CMOS layout is designed, extracted, checked, and eventually simulated to compare the transient response between the ideal schematic built and the extracted layout view that includes parasitic elements.

ðŸ’½ [Project 2: 3-input Logic Gate Design](https://github.com/nvkoleva-ibeXiae/vlsi-design/blob/master/3-Input%20Logic%20Gate%20Cadence%20Design/3input-logic-gate_cadence.pdf) is the design of the logic expression f=(AB+C)', which includes one AND, one OR, and one NOT gate. It is initially built as an nfet/pfet CMOS schematic, then converted to a layout and subsequent extraction, after which it is DRC checked and run through LVS to ensure all netlists match. The objective is to once again view how parasitic components impact a circuit's transient response and behavior in the real-world.
